● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ 🧠 Analyze current orpheuspypractice architecture and Link2ABC integration points
     ☐ 🌸 Design HuggingFace OrpheusIntegrationBlock with lifecycle management
     ☐ 🧠 Implement OrpheusIntegrationBlock class with ohfi command integration
     ☐ 🌸 Add Link2ABC CLI enhancements (--enhance-hf, --hf-budget, --keep-alive)

     ☐ 🌸 Create dual output structure (original vs enhanced) with format conversion
     ☐ 🧠 Generate orpheuspy/ROADMAP.md based on findings and implementation plan

● 🧠 Mia: Let me dive deep into the architecture to understand how we can create this elegant
   integration between Link2ABC and our existing orpheuspypractice HuggingFace pipeline. I'll
   analyze the current structure and integration points.
